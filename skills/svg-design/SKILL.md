# SVG Creation and Editing

**Core principle:** SVGs are code. Write them by hand like you'd write any markup: clean, minimal, semantically meaningful. Every element and attribute should earn its place.

## Topic Routing

| Task | Load reference |
|------|---------------|
| Arc flag combinations, common path shapes | [references/path-patterns.md](references/path-patterns.md) |
| Logo design, typography, negative space | [references/logo-techniques.md](references/logo-techniques.md) |
| Icon design, grid systems, pixel alignment | [references/icon-design.md](references/icon-design.md) |
| Gradients, masks, clips, filters, transforms (design decisions) | [references/advanced-techniques.md](references/advanced-techniques.md) |
| Animation (CSS keyframes, stagger, GPU, easing, SVG-specific) | [references/animation.md](references/animation.md) |
| Optimization, sprites, SVGO config | [references/optimization.md](references/optimization.md) |
| Accessibility, browser pitfalls | [references/accessibility-and-pitfalls.md](references/accessibility-and-pitfalls.md) |
| Editing workflow, boolean operations, combining SVGs | [references/editing-workflow.md](references/editing-workflow.md) |

## SVG Skeleton

Always start from this structure:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
  <!-- content -->
</svg>
```

Adjust `viewBox` to match the design canvas. Omit `width`/`height` attributes to let the SVG scale with its container (add them only when a fixed size is needed).

## Canvas Size Conventions

| Size | Use case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `0 0 16 16` | Micro icons, favicons | Heroicons micro, GitHub Octicons |
| `0 0 20 20` | Small UI icons, form elements | Heroicons mini |
| `0 0 24 24` | Standard icons (most common) | Lucide, Heroicons outline, Material |
| `0 0 32 32` | Medium icons, navigation | Phosphor uses 256x256 internally |
| `0 0 48 48` | Large display icons | App icons, illustrations |
| Custom | Logos, illustrations | Match the natural aspect ratio |

**Default to 24x24** unless there's a reason not to. It's the industry standard.

## Shape vs Path Decision

| Use shape primitive when... | Use `<path>` when... |
|---|---|
| The shape is a basic geometric form | The shape has curves, complex outlines |
| Readability matters (a circle should look like `<circle>`) | You need to minimize element count |
| You need to animate individual properties (r, cx, cy) | Combining multiple shapes into one element |
| The shape will be programmatically modified | Exporting from design tools (paths are universal) |

## Styling Defaults

Set these on the root `<svg>` element to avoid repetition on children:

| Attribute | Icon default | Logo default | Why |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----|
| `fill` | `none` | varies | Icons are typically stroked, logos are filled |
| `stroke` | `currentColor` | `none` or `currentColor` | Inherits text color from parent |
| `stroke-width` | `2` (on 24x24) | varies | Consistent weight across icons |
| `stroke-linecap` | `round` | `round` or `butt` | Rounded ends look cleaner at small sizes |
| `stroke-linejoin` | `round` | `round` or `miter` | Prevents sharp spikes at joins |

**`currentColor` is your friend.** It lets the SVG inherit whatever color the parent element has, making icons themeable with zero extra CSS.

## Stroke-Width Relative to ViewBox

`stroke-width` is in viewBox units, not pixels. Always set relative to your canvas dimensions:

| viewBox | Typical stroke-width | Visual result |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| 16x16 | 1.5 | ~9.4% of canvas |
| 24x24 | 2 | ~8.3% of canvas |
| 32x32 | 2-2.5 | ~6.3-7.8% of canvas |
| 48x48 | 3 | ~6.3% of canvas |
| 256x256 | 16 | ~6.3% of canvas |

## When to Convert Shapes to Paths

**Convert when:**
- Combining multiple shapes into a single compound path (boolean operations)
- You need the shape as part of a larger path composition
- Distributing to environments that only support `<path>`
- Optimizing for minimal DOM elements

**Keep as shapes when:**
- Code readability matters (a `<circle>` is self-documenting)
- You need to animate specific properties (animating `r` on a circle is cleaner than animating path data)
- The SVG will be programmatically modified

### Rounded rect-to-path template

The arc parameters here are error-prone to derive. Use this as a reference:

```xml
<!-- <rect x="2" y="2" width="20" height="20" rx="3" /> becomes: -->
<path d="M 5 2 h 14 a 3 3 0 0 1 3 3 v 14 a 3 3 0 0 1 -3 3 h -14 a 3 3 0 0 1 -3 -3 v -14 a 3 3 0 0 1 3 -3 Z" />
```

## fill-rule: evenodd vs nonzero

Use `evenodd` when you have compound shapes with holes. It's simpler because you don't need to worry about winding direction:

```xml
<!-- Donut using evenodd (direction doesn't matter) -->
<path fill-rule="evenodd" d="
  M 12 2 A 10 10 0 1 1 12 22 A 10 10 0 1 1 12 2 Z
  M 12 7 A 5 5 0 1 1 12 17 A 5 5 0 1 1 12 7 Z
" fill="black" />
```

With `nonzero` (default), the inner circle must wind in the opposite direction to create the hole.

## Logo Design Process

When creating logos (not icons), follow this process:

0. **Always clarify design direction before creating logos.** Prefer structured clarification (forms, pick-lists, or equivalent structured question UI) before writing any SVG code. If the environment does not support structured input, ask the same questions in concise, choice-based plain text rather than open-ended brainstorming. This step is mandatory for all logo projects. Even when the user provides some direction (like "modern" or "YC style"), those are vibes, not design briefs. A designer would still present options to narrow the direction before investing in 5-15 concepts.

    Present choices like a designer showing mood boards. Don't ask open-ended questions. Tailor options to the user's domain:

    ```text
    Mood:
    - Bold & geometric — Clean shapes, strong lines, confident. Think Stripe, Figma.
    - Organic & crafted — Hand-drawn feel, natural curves, warmth. Think Mailchimp, Basecamp.
    - Minimal & typographic — Wordmark-driven, restrained, sophisticated. Think Glossier, Everlane.
    - Playful & dynamic — Energetic, colorful, movement. Think Slack, Discord.

    Focus:
    - What we do — Visual metaphor tied to the product's core function.
    - How it feels — Abstract mark that conveys emotion or energy.
    - Who we are — Letterform or wordmark built from the brand name.

    Inspiration:
    - Populate with 3-4 real, well-known brands in or adjacent to the user's domain.
    - Replace the examples entirely for each industry.
    - Example AI/startup set: Linear, Stripe, Notion, Vercel.
    ```

    **Tailoring the questions to the domain is critical.** The mood options, focus options, and especially the inspiration logos must be specific to the user's industry. A coffee brand gets Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Intelligentsia, Counter Culture as inspiration options. A fintech startup gets Stripe, Plaid, Mercury, Ramp. A fitness app gets Peloton, Strava, Nike Run Club, Whoop. Pick brands the user will immediately recognize and have an opinion about. The inspiration question does the most work here because it anchors the entire aesthetic direction to something concrete.

    The only exception: skip if the user has specified both a concrete visual style AND specific imagery (e.g., "minimalist geometric logo using a mountain silhouette in navy blue").

1. **Explore multiple metaphors, not multiple layouts of one metaphor.** Conceptual diversity matters more than layout variations. Follow the full ideation process in [references/logo-techniques.md](references/logo-techniques.md), which covers domain-specific brainstorming, category diversity requirements, and cliche avoidance.
2. **Guarantee structural variety.** Every logo set must span multiple *categories* of approach, not just multiple metaphors within the same style. Include at least one from each column when presenting 5+ options: a typographic/wordmark approach, a symbolic icon, an abstract geometric mark, and a letterform-meets-metaphor hybrid. See the category diversity table in [references/logo-techniques.md](references/logo-techniques.md).
3. **Use symmetry and modules deliberately.** For technical or system-oriented brands, start from a base unit and decide whether the mark benefits from reflection, rotation, or translation before adding detail. Think in terms of one generator plus transformations, not a pile of unrelated parts. Break symmetry only on purpose to create focus, direction, or a memorable quirk.
4. **Set up the preview immediately, then populate it progressively.** Don't design all logos first and then show them. The user should see results as they're created:
    1. Copy this skill's `assets/preview.html` to the project directory using `cp` with the absolute path from where this skill was loaded (do not read or modify the file).
    2. Design the first logo and write its SVG file.
    3. Write `variants.js` with just that first variant (format in [references/editing-workflow.md](references/editing-workflow.md)).
    4. Open the preview with `open preview.html` (macOS) or `xdg-open preview.html` (Linux). The user now sees the first logo while you keep working.
    5. For each subsequent logo: write the SVG file, then update `variants.js` to add it. The preview auto-reloads both every 3 seconds, so new logos appear in the browser as they're completed.

    This gives the user visual feedback within seconds of the first logo being ready, rather than waiting for all logos to be designed before seeing anything.
5. **For colored logos, always create a `-dark.svg` variant.** Dark navy edges (#1E3A5F) that look great on white disappear on dark backgrounds. Dark variants need lighter edges (#4B8BBE), lighter rings (#3B6B8A), and off-white centers (#E2E8F0).
6. **Plan your vertical budget before drawing.** On a 32x32 canvas with 3 stacked elements, you have ~30 usable units. Sketch the vertical distribution first (e.g., box=12, gap=2, layer=5, gap=2, layer=5) to avoid clipping at viewBox edges.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do instead |
|-------|-----------|
| Hardcode `width="24" height="24"` without `viewBox` | Use `viewBox` always; add width/height only if needed |
| Set `fill="none"` on a `<g>` group | Set fill on individual elements or the root `<svg>` |
| Use `px` units inside SVG | SVG coordinates are unitless; they map to viewBox |
| Include editor metadata (`<sodipodi:*>`, `<inkscape:*>`) | Strip all editor cruft |
| Use `<text>` for logo wordmarks in distributed SVGs | Convert text to paths for portability |
| Nest transforms three levels deep | Flatten transforms into path coordinates |
| Use `xlink:href` | Use `href` (xlink is deprecated) |
| Forget `xmlns` on standalone SVG files | Always include `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` |
| Use decimal precision beyond 2-3 places for icons | Round to 2 decimals for icons, 3 max for complex art |

## Cross-References

- **Design aesthetics**: If the environment has a broader visual design skill or workflow, use it for brand positioning, visual language, and non-SVG-specific art direction
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Use a Mermaid- or diagram-specific skill/workflow for node-edge diagrams; this skill focuses on SVG assets rather than diagram authoring
